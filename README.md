# Hermes Agent ☤ — unofficial fork

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is an unofficial fork** of [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), maintained by [@majorissuerep](https://github.com/majorissuerep) for personal infrastructure.
> It is **not** built, supported, or endorsed by Nous Research. It diverges from upstream — encrypted state at rest (vault), different security defaults, fork-only integrations — and its behavior is only tested on the maintainer's machines.
> **Be cautious:** review the [differences vs upstream](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/compare/main...majorissuerep:hermes-agent:main) before installing, inspect the installer before piping it to a shell, and report fork issues [here](https://github.com/majorissuerep/hermes-agent/issues) — never upstream. If you are looking for the original project, use [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

**A fork of the self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com) (upstream).** Same learning loop — skills from experience, agent-curated memory, cross-session recall — plus fork-only hardening: encrypted state at rest under a master-password/key-file vault, a configurable switch to disable all external messaging adapters, and profile-scoped secrets. It runs on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure. Not tied to your laptop — talk to it from a messaging platform while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and [many others](website/docs/integrations/providers.md). Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

> [!WARNING]
> **This installs the FORK** (this repository), not the original Hermes Agent. The one-liners below fetch the installer **from this fork's git history** — always [read it first](https://github.com/majorissuerep/hermes-agent/blob/main/scripts/install.sh) before piping anything into a shell. For the original, supported product use [the upstream installer](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

### Linux, macOS, WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/majorissuerep/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Troubleshooting
---

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes config get   # Print individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search, image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](website/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway.md).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |

| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:

- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
